The Dart Tooling MCP Server exposes Dart and Flutter development tool actions to compatible AI-assistant clients.

## Status

WIP. This package is still experimental and is likely to evolve quickly.

## Set up your MCP client

> Note: all of the following set up instructions require Dart 3.9.0-163.0.dev or later.

<!-- Note: since many of our tools require access to the Dart Tooling Daemon, we may want
to be cautious about recommending tools where access to the Dart Tooling Daemon does not exist. -->

The Dart MCP server can work with any MCP client that supports standard I/O (stdio) as the
transport medium. To access all the features of the Dart MCP server, an MCP client must support
[Tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools) and
[Resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/resources). For the best development
experience with the Dart MCP server, an MCP client should also support
[Roots](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/roots).

If you are using a client that claims it supports roots but does not actually
set them, pass `--force-roots-fallback` which will instead enable tools for
managing the roots.

Here are specific instructions for some popular tools:

### Gemini CLI

To configure the [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) to use the Dart MCP
server, edit the `.gemini/settings.json` file in your local project (configuration will only
apply to this project) or edit the global `~/.gemini/settings.json` file in your home directory
(configuration will apply for all projects).

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dart": {
      "command": "dart",
      "args": [
        "mcp-server",
        "--experimental-mcp-server", // Can be removed for Dart 3.9.0 or later.
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

For more information, see the official Gemini CLI documentation for
[setting up MCP servers](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/docs/tools/mcp-server.md#how-to-set-up-your-mcp-server).

### Gemini Code Assist in VS Code

> Note: this currently requires the "Insiders" channel. Follow
[instructions](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/use-agentic-chat-pair-programmer#before-you-begin)
to enable this build.

[Gemini Code Assist](https://codeassist.google/)'s
[Agent mode](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/use-agentic-chat-pair-programmer) integrates the Gemini CLI to provide a powerful
AI agent directly in your IDE. To configure Gemini Code Assist to use the Dart MCP
server, follow the instructions to [configure the Gemini](#gemini-cli) CLI above.

You can verify the MCP server has been configured properly by typing `/mcp` in the chat window in Agent mode.

For more information see the official Gemini Code Assist documentation for
[using agent mode](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/use-agentic-chat-pair-programmer#before-you-begin).

<!-- ### Android Studio -->
<!-- TODO(https://github.com/dart-lang/ai/issues/199): once we are confident that the
Dart MCP server will work well with Android Studio's MCP support, add documentation here
for configuring the server in Android Studio. -->

### Cursor

[![Add to Cursor](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](https://cursor.com/install-mcp?name=dart&config=eyJ0eXBlIjoic3RkaW8iLCJjb21tYW5kIjoiZGFydCBtY3Atc2VydmVyIC0tZXhwZXJpbWVudGFsLW1jcC1zZXJ2ZXIgLS1mb3JjZS1yb290cy1mYWxsYmFjayJ9)

The easiest way to configure the Dart MCP server with Cursor is by clicking the "Add to Cursor"
button above.

Alternatively, you can configure the server manually. Go to **Cursor -> Settings -> Cursor Settings > Tools & Integrations**, and then click **"Add Custom MCP"** or **"New MCP Server"**
depending on whether you already have other MCP servers configured. Edit the `.cursor/mcp.json` file in your local project (configuration will only apply to this project) or
edit the global `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file in your home directory (configuration will apply for
all projects) to configure the Dart MCP server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dart": {
      "command": "dart",
      "args": [
        "mcp-server",
        "--experimental-mcp-server", // Can be removed for Dart 3.9.0 or later
        "--force-roots-fallback" // Workaround for a Cursor issue with Roots support
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

For more information, see the official Cursor documentation for
[installing MCP servers](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#installing-mcp-servers).

### GitHub Copilot in VS Code

<!-- TODO: once the dart.mcpServer setting is not hidden, we may be able
to provide a deep link to the Dart Extension Settings UI for users to
enable the server. See docs: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/settings#_settings-editor.
This may be preferable to adding the deep link button to VS Code's mcp settings. -->

> Note: requires Dart-Code VS Code extension v3.114 or later.

To configure the Dart MCP server with Copilot or any other AI agent that supports the
[VS Code MCP API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/mcp), add the following
to your VS Code user settings (Command Palette > **Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)**):
```json
"dart.mcpServer": true
```

By adding this setting, the Dart VS Code extension will register the Dart MCP Server
configuration with VS Code so that you don't have to manually configure the server.
Copilot will then automatically configure the Dart MCP server on your behalf. This is
a global setting. If you'd like the setting to apply only to a specific workspace, add
the entry to your workspace settings (Command Palette > **Preferences: Open Workspace Settings (JSON)**)
instead.

For more information, see the official VS Code documentation for
[enabling MCP support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_enable-mcp-support-in-vs-code).

## Tools

<!-- run 'dart tool/update_readme.dart' to update -->

<!-- generated -->

| Tool Name | Title | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `connect_dart_tooling_daemon` | Connect to DTD | Connects to the Dart Tooling Daemon. You should get the uri either from available tools or the user, do not just make up a random URI to pass. When asking the user for the uri, you should suggest the "Copy DTD Uri to clipboard" action. When reconnecting after losing a connection, always request a new uri first. |
| `get_runtime_errors` | Get runtime errors | Retrieves the most recent runtime errors that have occurred in the active Dart or Flutter application. Requires "connect_dart_tooling_daemon" to be successfully called first. |
| `hot_reload` | Hot reload | Performs a hot reload of the active Flutter application. This is to apply the latest code changes to the running application. Requires "connect_dart_tooling_daemon" to be successfully called first. |
| `get_widget_tree` | Get widget tree | Retrieves the widget tree from the active Flutter application. Requires "connect_dart_tooling_daemon" to be successfully called first. |
| `get_selected_widget` | Get selected widget | Retrieves the selected widget from the active Flutter application. Requires "connect_dart_tooling_daemon" to be successfully called first. |
| `set_widget_selection_mode` | Set Widget Selection Mode | Enables or disables widget selection mode in the active Flutter application. Requires "connect_dart_tooling_daemon" to be successfully called first. |
| `get_active_location` | Get Active Editor Location | Retrieves the current active location (e.g., cursor position) in the connected editor. Requires "connect_dart_tooling_daemon" to be successfully called first. |
| `pub_dev_search` | pub.dev search | Searches pub.dev for packages relevant to a given search query. The response will describe each result with its download count, package description, topics, license, and publisher. |
| `remove_roots` | Remove roots | Removes one or more project roots previously added via the add_roots tool. |
| `add_roots` | Add roots | Adds one or more project roots. Tools are only allowed to run under these roots, so you must call this function before passing any roots to any other tools. |
| `dart_fix` | Dart fix | Runs `dart fix --apply` for the given project roots. |
| `dart_format` | Dart format | Runs `dart format .` for the given project roots. |
| `run_tests` | Run tests | Run Dart or Flutter tests with an agent centric UX. ALWAYS use instead of `dart test` or `flutter test` shell commands. |
